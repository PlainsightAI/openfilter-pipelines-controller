  # Filters process the RTSP stream
  # The controller constructs and injects RTSP_URL from host/port/path
  # Without credentials: rtsp://host:port/path (e.g., rtsp://camera.example.com:554/stream1)
  # With credentials: rtsp://$_RTSP_USERNAME:$_RTSP_PASSWORD@host:port/path
  #   (credentials are auto-substituted at runtime from the Secret)
